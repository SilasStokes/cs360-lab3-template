As a tip: KC's MTX textbook has a better description of the code needed to pipe. 

# Autograder Test:
The auto grader for this lab is simply making sure the code compiles using the mk script. 

To do so - it is running './mk' and then using regex to make sure a new a.out is created.

You are free to change mk, but DO NOT change it to auto-run the executable. This will result in the autograder timing out (since your program is waiting for user input).
